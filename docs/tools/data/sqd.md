## About SQD

[SQD](https://sqd.dev/) (previously Subsquid) unlocks next-gen functionality for dApps, AI agents, analytics and ZK Proofs/TEE through blazing-fast indexing.

[SQD](https://sqd.dev/) is a decentralized hyper-scalable data platform optimized for providing efficient, permissionless access to large volumes of data. It currently serves historical on-chain data, including event logs, transaction receipts, traces, and per-transaction state diffs. SQD offers a powerful toolkit for creating custom data extraction and processing pipelines, achieving an indexing speed of up to 150k blocks per second.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.sqd.dev/) or see [EVM examples](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/squid-evm-examples) of what you can build with SQD.

#### Supported Networks

- Polygon Mainnet
- Polygon Amoy Testnet
- Polygon zkEVM
- Polygon zkEVM Cardona Testnet

## Why SQD?

- **Faster Development**: SQD simplifies blockchain data access with its Squid SDK, allowing developers to write custom queries without getting bogged down in low-level blockchain protocols. This translates to quicker development times.
- **Cost-Effective**: SQD offers free retrieval of historical blockchain data, eliminating a significant cost barrier for developers building data-driven applications.
- **Scalability**: The decentralized architecture of SQD allows for infinite horizontal scaling, meaning it can handle massive amounts of data without compromising performance.
- **Flexibility**: SQD supports a wide range of blockchains (including Layer 1 and Layer 2) and provides a developer-friendly interface for building custom indexers tailored to specific needs.

## What can you build with SQD?

Here is an incomplete list of ideas of what one can build with SQD:

- DeFi dashboards, tracking addresses and internal transactions
- NFT marketplaces, with a dynamic sets of NFT contracts to watch
- Historical price feeds, tracking Uniswap trades and Chainlink oracle contracts
- Mining smart contract deployments and the bytecode
- Real-time bots (<1sec delay) triggered by on-chain activity

SQD also enables cutting-edge use cases like AI agents, RAGs, ZK proofs, and TEE coprocessors.

## How to host SQD APIs

There are generally two ways how you can host your SQD APIs:

- **Self-Hosting**: You can manage your own infrastructure and deploy your SQD project (squid) yourself.
- **SQD Cloud**: This is a hosted service by SQD that takes care of the infrastructure management for you.
